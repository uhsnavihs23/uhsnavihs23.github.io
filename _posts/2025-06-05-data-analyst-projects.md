Welcome to my portfolio of data analysis projects! This post highlights my work, starting with an in-depth analysis of customer shopping trends. Iâ€™ll add more projects as I continue to grow my skill set.

## Projects

### Project 1: Customer Shopping Trends Analysis

This project dives into the [Customer Shopping Latest Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes shopping behaviors of 3,900 customers across demographics, preferences, and product categories. Using Python in Google Colab, I cleaned the data, ran SQL-style queries, and created visualizations to uncover actionable insights.
