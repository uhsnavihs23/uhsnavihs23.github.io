Hi, I’m Shivanshu Sharma! 

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet.
This site is where I share my passions, projects, and discoveries. You’ll find a mix of:

Projects & Learning: From code snippets to Google Colab tools and Excel projects, I document my learning journey and share practical utilities I’ve built.
Recommendations: Dive into my curated lists of favorite movies (complete with thumbnails), songs that inspire me, and travel itineraries to spark your next adventure.
Personal Thoughts: A space for reflections, ideas, and stories that shape my perspective.

Whether you’re here for tech tips, entertainment picks, or travel inspiration, I hope you find something that resonates. Stay tuned for new posts, and feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/uhsnavihs23) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivanshu-sharma-2302/).
